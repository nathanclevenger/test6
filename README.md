# [Landing Page Template](https://github.com/nathanclevenger/landing-page/generate)

First, [create a new project from this template](https://github.com/nathanclevenger/landing-page/generate) to create your site.

Then, customize the [`_config.yaml`](/_config.yaml):

```yaml
remote_theme: nathanclevenger/landing

icon: ðŸš€
name: Landing.Page.as
description: Get your idea launched in seconds with simplest and most easy-to-use landing page template you've ever worked with.
```

Finally, go to [GitHub Pages in the repo settings](../../settings/pages), to enable GitHub Pages publishing, and add a CNAME to get a custom domain running.
